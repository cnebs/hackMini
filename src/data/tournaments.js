      We are providing a space for people of all backgrounds who want to start building their tech portfolio or finish up a tech project while learning new skills. Previous experience in tech is **NOT** required. 
      Plus, we have a parallel FREE workshop track for anyone who wants to come and just start learning, learn more, or meet people. 
      Not sure what to work on? We encourage participants to look into open data or civic hacking projects, for more information check out Open Austin.`,
